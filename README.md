# User Input Statistics

Program Start:
- The user may use this program to either view a concatenated string of words, or to view statistics about the numbers they input.
- Initially, the user will be prompted to either select 'word' or 'number' to indicate the mode they would like to use. The first valid response executes the applicable remainder of the program.

Word Splicer 
- The user inputs as many or as few words as desired. Once the user has finished providing words, they may press 'Enter' in order to terminate the input acceptance function.
- The program will print out a word spliced together from all the previous valid entries. 
- If at any point the user provides a non-word input, the program will terminate.

By the Numbers 
- The user inputs as many or as few numbers as desired. Once the user has finished providing words, they may press 'Enter' in order to terminate the input acceptance function.
- The program will print out primary statistical data based on the input provided. The sum, number, and average of the entered numbers will be displayed.
- If at any point the user provides a non-numeric input, the program will terminate.
